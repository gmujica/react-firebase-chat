This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project director you can run

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
